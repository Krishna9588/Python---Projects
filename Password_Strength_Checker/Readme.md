#  Password Strength Checker

### About Python libraries used in this project
1. `Thinker` - Tk interface
2. `re` - Regular Expressions

**Tk** is used in [PSC_with_GUI.py](PSC_With_GUI.py) file where,
we are using it to build a simple interface with basic functionality.

And

**Re** is used in PSC [Basic](PSC_Basic.py) and With [GUI](PSC_With_GUI.py) file. 
It's set the criteria for the password which further will be checked by our program.

## About code
- In this we check for Length, Uppercase, Lowercase, Digit, Special Character
- Thinker is use to create an inter-face for the user to inter it is password
- And the password entered is hidden by the * symbol.

### To check if libraries are working properly
- I have included 2 files named [test_for_re_lib.py](Test_For_re_lib.py) and [test_for_tkinter_lib.py](Test_for_tkinter_lib.py).
- which will check if the lib's are working properly or not on new system's.
